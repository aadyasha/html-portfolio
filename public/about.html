<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there
  I am Aadyasha Sahoo, a second-year student at Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology Burla, and an enthusiast.
  
  <br />
  This is my first web development project, and I want to work on more in the future.
  In retrospect, I realise that I have always been a voracious student in addition to the fact that web development represents one of my passions. This has lately motivated me to learn new things through coding and improving my understanding in this field of study.
  <br />
  
  One of the projects that best demonstrates the more than five weeks of effort and ongoing education I got is this one.
